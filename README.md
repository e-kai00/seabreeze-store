## Seabreeze Store

The Seabreeze website is a company profile for a small business specializing in handmade jewelry. The website features four pages: the Home page, which includes the company address and explains the business and its benefits; the Product page, which showcases various jewelry collections; the Contact page, which allows visitors to fill out a contact form; and the Download page, which offers a downloadable PDF booklet. The website has a responsive and visually appealing design, built using Bootstrap, a popular front-end development framework.

I created this mini project with the purpose to learn functionalities of the Bootstrap framework. It is based on a walkthrough 'Resume' project from Code Institute.
